/**
 * @file firestore.rules
 * @description Security rules for a single-page portfolio website with an admin dashboard.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a dual-access security model:
 * 1. Public-Read: Core portfolio content (site settings, categories, projects, gallery) is publicly readable by any visitor, including unauthenticated ones.
 * 2. Admin-Only Write: All content creation, modification, and deletion are restricted to authenticated administrators. For prototyping, any non-anonymous authenticated user is considered an admin.
 * 3. Private Data "Dropbox": A dedicated collection for contact messages allows any user to submit (create) a message, but only admins can read or manage them.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into distinct, top-level collections to enforce a clear separation of security concerns (Structural Segregation):
 * - /siteContent: Singleton collection for global website configuration.
 * - /projectCategories: Defines categories for portfolio projects.
 * - /galleryCategories: Defines categories for gallery images.
 * - /projects: Contains the individual portfolio projects.
 * - /galleryImages: Stores images for the public gallery.
 * - /contactMessages: A private collection to store user-submitted contact form messages.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Role Assumption: There is no explicit admin role system defined. For rapid prototyping, we treat any user authenticated via a non-anonymous provider (e.g., email/password) as an administrator with full write privileges. This should be replaced with a more robust system (like custom claims) for production.
 * - Public Read Access: To support the public-facing portfolio, all content except contact messages is world-readable.
 * - Secure Contact Form: The `/contactMessages` collection is designed as a secure "dropbox". Anyone can write into it, but nobody can read its contents except for administrators, preventing data leaks. List operations are disabled for the public.
 * - No User Listing: The rules do not depend on a `/users` collection, thus avoiding any possibility of listing user accounts.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset does not require complex `get()` calls to check permissions. Access is determined by a simple role check (`isAdmin()`) on the user's authentication token, making the rules fast, performant, and easy to audit.
